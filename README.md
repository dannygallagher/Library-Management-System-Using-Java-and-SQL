# Library Management System Using Java and SQL

A simple library management system built in Java and pulling data from a MYSQL database. The system includes roles for staff and patrons. Patrons can create new accounts, and after doing so can
check out, return, and place holds on books. Librarians can view available books, holds, and overdue books based on either Patron Ids or book author, and can manipulate patron holds.

The purpose of this project was to explore database connections and basic GUIs in Java as opposed to web scraping or
data engineering, and so the database is populated with placeholder data.
